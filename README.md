# **Pomodoro Timer**
This Python code implements a basic Pomodoro timer. The Pomodoro technique is a time management approach that entails working for a certain length of time (typically 25 minutes), taking a brief break (usually 5-10 minutes), and then repeating the procedure. The idea is that by dividing your work into shorter, more focused times, you will be able to be more productive and focused throughout the day.
After each Pomodoro cycle, this timer displays desktop alerts using the time and plyer libraries. The program will display a notice inviting the user to take a break after 25 minutes of work. Following the end of the break, the program will display another notice to remind the user to return to work.
Simply execute the code in a Python environment to use this timer. The program will begin to run and will display a notice indicating that the timer has begun. You may then focus on your duties while the timer keeps track of your Pomodoros.
### Note:
You might alter the time to change the length of the work and break intervals. The sleep function parameters should be modified to match the required time (in seconds). You may, for example, modify the time if you wish to work for 30 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Arguments about sleep and time.sleep(1800) and time.sleep(300), in that order.
